This repository contains an R script that demonstrates two methods for visualizing relationships in UX data.

Regression Plot:
We simulate a scenario where user engagement might predict overall satisfaction. A regression plot (created with ggplot2) shows the direct relationship between these two variables.

Path Analysis Diagram:
To go beyond the direct effect, a simple path analysis diagram is created using DiagrammeR. This diagram maps out a possible model where Engagement influences Satisfaction both directly and indirectly through Positive Emotion.

These examples are intended to help UX researchers and human factors professionals explore both direct and indirect pathways in their data.
